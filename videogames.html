<p>Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.</p>

<p>What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare you pain, I burnt that letter?</p>

<p>Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.</p>

<p>Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just wanna watch the world burn.</p>

<p>You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.</p>

<p>There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes, the pit sends something back.</p>

<p>Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud.</p>

<p>It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.</p>

<p>Batman may have made the front page but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.</p>

<p>Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training. I see the power of belief. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.</p>

<p>If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."</p>

<p>I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.</p>

<p>I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.</p>

<p>You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.</p>
