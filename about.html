<p>I'm Batman</p>

<p>I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.</p>

<p>Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.</p>

<p>It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.</p>

<p>Swear to me!</p>

<p>Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.</p>

<p>Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.</p>

<p>My anger outweights my guilt.</p>

<p>I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.</p>

<p>The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.</p>

<p>Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.</p>

<p>I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.</p>

<p>Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.</p>

<p>Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.</p>
